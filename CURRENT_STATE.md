## Key Project Components

### Agent System
The project implements a sophisticated multi-agent coordination system with:
- **Main LLM**: Coordination and delegation only (no direct implementation)
- **Specialist Agents**: Domain-specific implementation agents
- **Quality Gates**: Mandatory review sequence
- **Simplicity Enforcement**: Pre-implementation and pre-commit KISS principle enforcement

### Core Rules (from CLAUDE.md)
- **Mandatory Delegation**: Main LLM cannot perform programming tasks directly
- **Simplicity First**: design-simplicity-advisor must review before ANY implementation
- **Quality Sequence**: code-reviewer → code-clarity-manager → unit-test-expert → design-simplicity-advisor (pre-commit) → git-workflow-manager
- **Agent Specialization**: Clear domain boundaries with overlap resolution

### Current Focus
Based on recent commits, the project is focused on:
1. Removing centralized orchestrator in favor of direct Main LLM coordination
2. Enhancing agent system capabilities and coordination
3. Implementing automatic quality gates
4. Adding comprehensive simplicity enforcement

## Next Steps
With multiple modified files ready for commit, the next logical steps would be:
1. Review all changes for consistency
2. Run pre-commit simplicity analysis
3. Commit the current work
4. Address any remaining documentation or system improvements
