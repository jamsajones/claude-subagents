# Orchestration Test Scenarios

## Should Trigger Orchestration:
1. "implement a new user authentication system"
2. "create three components: login, signup, and dashboard"
3. "fix the deployment pipeline and update the infrastructure"
4. "refactor the codebase and add comprehensive testing"
5. "commit these changes and create a pull request"

## Should NOT Trigger Orchestration:
1. "What is TypeScript?"
2. "How does JWT authentication work?"
3. "Read the README.md file"
4. "Show me the current git status"
5. "Explain the deployment process"

## Testing Notes:
- Rules now appear at top of CLAUDE.md with clear formatting
- Trigger detection simplified with bullet points
- System configuration already provides backup enforcement
- Context overload reduced through prioritization and simplification
