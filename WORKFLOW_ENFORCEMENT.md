# Workflow Enforcement Guide

## Problem Statement: Current System Complexity

The current 7-agent sequential chain is theoretically robust but practically fragile:

### Current Complex Flow
```
Implementation → code-reviewer → code-clarity-manager → 
top-down-analyzer + bottom-up-analyzer → unit-test-expert → 
design-simplicity-advisor (pre-commit) → git-workflow-manager
```

### Key Problems
1. **No Real Enforcement**: Relies entirely on LLM compliance with no technical safeguards
2. **Single Point of Failure**: Any agent skip breaks the entire chain
3. **Coordination Overhead**: 7 sequential steps with multiple parallel sub-processes
4. **State Management**: No tracking of workflow progress or failures
5. **Recovery Complexity**: Unclear failure modes and restart procedures

## Proposed Solution: Simplified 3-Step Workflow

### New Simplified Flow
```
Implementation → Quality Gate → Git Operations → Documentation
```

### Step 1: Quality Gate (Combined Check)
- **Purpose**: Single quality validation combining all necessary checks
- **Actions**: Code review, testing, simplicity analysis, security scan
- **Output**: Pass/fail decision with specific remediation requirements
- **Enforcement**: State file tracks completion

### Step 2: Git Operations
- **Purpose**: Handle all git-related operations (commit, branch, PR)
- **Trigger**: Only after quality gate passes
- **Actions**: Commit with proper message, branch operations, PR creation
- **Enforcement**: Git hooks verify quality gate completion

### Step 3: Documentation
- **Purpose**: Update project documentation and changelog
- **Trigger**: After successful git operations
- **Actions**: Changelog update, documentation refresh
- **Enforcement**: Can be async/optional for rapid iterations

## Technical Enforcement Mechanisms

### 1. Simple State Tracking

Create `.workflow_state` file to track progress:

```bash
# .workflow_state example
WORKFLOW_STATUS=in_progress
QUALITY_GATE_STATUS=pending
LAST_IMPLEMENTATION_HASH=abc123def
QUALITY_GATE_TIMESTAMP=
GIT_OPERATIONS_STATUS=pending
DOCUMENTATION_STATUS=pending
```

### 2. Git Hooks for Bulletproof Enforcement

#### Pre-commit Hook (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Bulletproof workflow enforcement

# Check if quality gate completed
if [ ! -f .workflow_state ]; then
    echo "ERROR: No workflow state found. Run quality gate first."
    exit 1
fi

source .workflow_state

if [ "$QUALITY_GATE_STATUS" != "passed" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Quality gate not passed. Current status: $QUALITY_GATE_STATUS"
    echo "Run quality gate before committing."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if implementation changed since quality gate
CURRENT_HASH=$(git diff --cached | shasum | cut -d' ' -f1)
if [ "$CURRENT_HASH" != "$LAST_IMPLEMENTATION_HASH" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Code changed since quality gate. Re-run quality gate."
    exit 1
fi

echo "Quality gate verified. Proceeding with commit."
exit 0
```

#### Post-commit Hook (`.git/hooks/post-commit`)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Update workflow state after successful commit

echo "WORKFLOW_STATUS=completed" > .workflow_state
echo "GIT_OPERATIONS_STATUS=completed" >> .workflow_state
echo "DOCUMENTATION_STATUS=pending" >> .workflow_state
echo "COMMIT_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD)" >> .workflow_state

echo "Commit completed. Documentation update recommended."
```

### 3. Environment Variable Enforcement

```bash
# Set environment variables to track state
export CLAUDE_WORKFLOW_ACTIVE=true
export CLAUDE_QUALITY_GATE_REQUIRED=true
export CLAUDE_STATE_FILE=".workflow_state"
```

### 4. Quality Gate Script

Create `quality_gate.sh` for unified quality checking:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Unified quality gate script

set -e  # Exit on any error

echo "Starting Quality Gate..."

# 1. Code Review (basic checks)
echo "[1/4] Code review checks..."
if ! command -v shellcheck &> /dev/null && find . -name "*.sh" | head -1; then
    echo "WARNING: shellcheck not found, skipping script analysis"
fi

# 2. Testing (if tests exist)
echo "[2/4] Running tests..."
if [ -f "package.json" ] && grep -q "test" package.json; then
    npm test
elif [ -f "go.mod" ]; then
    go test ./...
elif [ -f "requirements.txt" ] && [ -f "test_*.py" ]; then
    python -m pytest
else
    echo "No tests found, skipping test phase"
fi

# 3. Security scan (basic)
echo "[3/4] Security scan..."
if [ -f "package.json" ] && command -v npm &> /dev/null; then
    npm audit --audit-level=high
fi

# 4. Simplicity analysis
echo "[4/4] Simplicity analysis..."
# Count complexity indicators
FUNCTION_COUNT=$(find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.go" -o -name "*.py" | xargs grep -c "function\|def\|func" 2>/dev/null | awk -F: '{sum += $2} END {print sum+0}')
FILE_COUNT=$(find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.go" -o -name "*.py" | wc -l)

if [ "$FUNCTION_COUNT" -gt 50 ]; then
    echo "WARNING: High function count ($FUNCTION_COUNT). Consider breaking down complex modules."
fi

if [ "$FILE_COUNT" -gt 20 ]; then
    echo "WARNING: High file count ($FILE_COUNT). Consider architectural review."
fi

# Update state file
IMPL_HASH=$(git diff --cached | shasum | cut -d' ' -f1)
cat > .workflow_state << EOF
WORKFLOW_STATUS=quality_gate_completed
QUALITY_GATE_STATUS=passed
LAST_IMPLEMENTATION_HASH=$IMPL_HASH
QUALITY_GATE_TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
GIT_OPERATIONS_STATUS=pending
DOCUMENTATION_STATUS=pending
EOF

echo "Quality Gate PASSED. Ready for git operations."
```

## Clear Failure Modes and Recovery

### Failure Mode 1: Quality Gate Fails
**Symptoms**: `quality_gate.sh` exits with non-zero code
**Recovery**: 
1. Fix the specific issues reported
2. Re-run `quality_gate.sh`
3. Proceed only after success

### Failure Mode 2: Git Hook Blocks Commit
**Symptoms**: Pre-commit hook rejects commit
**Recovery**:
1. Check `.workflow_state` file
2. If quality gate not run: `./quality_gate.sh`
3. If code changed: Re-run `./quality_gate.sh`
4. Retry commit

### Failure Mode 3: State File Corruption
**Symptoms**: Invalid or missing `.workflow_state`
**Recovery**:
1. Delete `.workflow_state`
2. Run `./quality_gate.sh` from scratch
3. Proceed with git operations

### Emergency Bypass (Use Sparingly)
```bash
# Emergency bypass for critical hotfixes
export CLAUDE_EMERGENCY_BYPASS=true
git commit --no-verify -m "EMERGENCY: [description]"
# Must schedule post-commit quality review
```

## Migration Path from Complex to Simple

### Phase 1: Install Simple System (Immediate)

## Benefits of Simplified System

1. **Reliability**: Git hooks provide technical enforcement vs. LLM compliance
2. **Simplicity**: 3 steps vs. 7 sequential agents
3. **Debuggability**: Clear state files and failure modes
4. **Speed**: Parallel quality checks vs. sequential agent chain
5. **Maintainability**: Shell scripts vs. complex agent coordination
6. **Flexibility**: Easy to customize per project needs

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Track Success Metrics
- Workflow completion rate
- Quality gate failure reasons
- Time from implementation to commit
- Emergency bypass frequency
- Developer satisfaction scores

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Target**: >95% workflow completion without bypass
- **Target**: <5 minutes average quality gate time
- **Target**: <2% emergency bypass rate
- **Target**: Zero commits without quality gate

This simplified system trades theoretical perfection for practical reliability, focusing on what actually prevents issues rather than comprehensive but fragile agent chains.
